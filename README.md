# Hardware 101: Winning Hackatons with Hardware

The repo contains a guide and presention on how to use hardware to win hackathons.  It goes over the basics of the hardware lifecycle from the fundamentals & ideation to fulfillment with a focus on getting a working prototype in a hackathon setting.


# Outline of Presentation
1. Background
1.1 About me
1.2 Hardware Fundamentals

2. Hardware Lifecycle
2.1 Hardware Tools
2.2 Q&A

3.  Resources

4. Building Stuff
4.1 Demo with Arduino

# Background

## Who am I?

###Andrew Andrade (andrew@andrewandrade.ca)
Hardware noob (strength: web searching skills)
Entrepreneur and 4A Mechatronics Engineering Student at uWaterloo

### Employement: hardware since highschool
1. Machine shop (CanTech & AllType)
2. Automotive Manufacturing (Chrysler)
3. Pipe and Membrane Manufacutring (Imtex Membranes)
4. Semi-conductor Manufacturing (Peraso Technologies)
5. Hardware Manufacturing (Facebook)
6. Various Manufacturing Consulting

### Hackathon wins with hardware:

1. Open Compute Summit V Hackathon Winner
Huge international summit with $5000 cash prize

## Hardware Fundamentals
- Hardware is very broad! (`hardware`engineering programs are not common)
- Hardware is difficult
"If it was easy, it would be call easyware"
- Hardware is fun (and flashy)!


### Types of Hardware (simplified)
In order of difficulty (for *hackathons*)

1. "Embedded" (ie. MYO, Pebble, etc)

2. Electrical (circuits, custom sensors, breadboards, etc.)
3. Mechanical (3d printing, machining, etc.)


## Hardware lifecycle

### Conceptualiazation
1. Idea
2. Specifications
3. Block Diagram

### Design & Test
4. Design
5. Prototyping
6. Test

### Demo!
????
7. Profit!

### Post hackathon
1. Customer discovery. market research
2. crowd funding?
3. design and optimization
4. manufacturing
5. marketing
6. retail
7. ...


## Parato Analysis
80:20 Rule

80% of the time goes into the planning
20% goes into the execution
or
20% of time goes into execution
80% goes into debugging


Errors in hardware are costly!

## Ideation
- Think of problem or need.want.desire
- Think of a simple do-able solution
- Think in terms of a demo (this is a hackathon)

## Concept
- hardware canvas
- block diagram
- part selection

## Design 
- part creation
- schematics.blue prints. etc.
- simulation and verification
- design review

## Prototyping

- breadboarding
- coding
- testing

## Demo

- get sleep!
